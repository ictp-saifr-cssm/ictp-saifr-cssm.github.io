I will introduce a network framework developed for the characterization of fluid transport dynamics in the ocean. The discretization of the sea surface in equal-sized cells brings to the construction of a new kind of networks, called Lagrangian Flow Networks (LFNs), describing water exchanges between different regions of the seascape. Using Network Theory concepts & tools we can study dispersion and mixing at both local and global scales evidencing relationships between network measures and dynamical properties of the flow. Among possible applications, I will show how such a framework could provide insights on marine meta-population ecology and climate science.
