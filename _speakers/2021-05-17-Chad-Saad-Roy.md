The COVID-19 pandemic is a global emergency with significant morbidity and mortality. In this talk, we use models to investigate the potential future SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, landscapes of immunity, and the effect of vaccination. Since there remain substantial uncertainty on the strength and duration of immunity following natural infection or vaccination, we examine a range of scenarios. Through a general framework, we also explore the potential epidemiological and evolutionary considerations of various vaccine dosing regimes.
