We will show how spatio-temporal chaos in networks with strongly
chaotic nodal dynamics can be tamed by dynamically changing links.
Specifically, we will illustrate the results in examples ranging from
neuronal networks to disease spreading models. Further we will show
how random links can prevent blow-ups in coupled nonlinear systems
suffering from unbounded growth. Lastly, we will demonstrate that
random links enhance the sensitivity of networks to heterogeneity.
