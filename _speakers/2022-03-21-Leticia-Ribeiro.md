In this talk, I’m going to present empirical, theoretical, and computational results in the emergence of self-organization and complexity in confined termites obtained by my collaborators and I. Briefly put, we track termites, which are social insects, confined in closed arenas, and use tools from Statistical Physics to study their movement patterns. As movement influences information flow, gene flow, foraging, and defense in colonies, its pattern is a key issue in understanding the dynamics of termites' social behavior. Additionally, understanding the connection between social context and movement may shed significant light on the basis upon which collective behavior emerges.

Furthermore, I’ll present more about the [“Parent in Science Movement”](https://www.parentinscience.com/). Our mission is to change how parenthood, more specifically, motherhood is perceived within academia, and to fight for a more equitable, diverse, and fair scientific environment.
