When nonlinear dynamical components interact through complex networks, interesting collective behaviors can emerge. I will start by describing chimera states, for which identical components coupled identically spontaneously break into coherent and incoherent groups. I will highlight an unexpected power law that emerges from noise-induced switching between chimeras. These chimeras can be seen as special cluster synchronization patterns, and I will introduce a unified framework to efficiently analyze the stability of arbitrary synchronization patterns. This framework can be naturally extended to networks with generalized interactions, including hypergraphs and temporal networks.
