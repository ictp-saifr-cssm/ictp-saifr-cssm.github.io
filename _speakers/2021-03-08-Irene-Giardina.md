Recent findings on flocks of birds and swarms of insects show that these groups exhibit strong correlations and obey static and dynamic scaling laws, thereby supporting a statistical physics approach. When modelling these systems, activity  is a fundamental trait, responsible for out-of-equilibrium properties on the large scale. Experiments however indicate that another crucial ingredient - behavioural inertia - is needed to reproduce the observed phenomenology. In this talk, after reviewing the experimental facts, I will discuss how these two ingredients can be appropriately incorporated in the theoretical description, both in microscopic models and at a coarse-grained level. The related field theory, including both dissipative and reversible dynamical terms, displays non-trivial collective dynamics, and its predictions are consistent with what observed in natural groups.
