Synchronization of coupled chaotic oscillators has been demonstrated and studied in a variety of systems and configurations, establishing that a nonlinear system can be driven to a particular state through input from a similar oscillator. In this presentation we briefly review a few aspects of synchronization of chaotic systems and discuss recent studies carried out in our group on synchronization of a receiving oscillator with a linear superposition of inputs from multiple equivalent driving systems. Results are demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental realization in electronic circuits.
