Higher-order networks [1] describe the many-body interactions of a large variety of complex systems, ranging from the brain to scientific collaboration networks. Simplicial complexes are generalized network structures which allow us to capture the combinatorial properties, the topology and the geometry of higher-order networks. In this talk we will show that simplicial complexes provide a very general mathematical framework to reveal how higher-order dynamics including synchronization  depends on simplicial network topology. We will show that higher-order synchronization describing the dynamics of topological signals defined on link, triangles and higher-dimensional simplices is explosive [2-4] and we will show that this rich dynamics can shade new light on the topological mechanisms that could lead to brain rhythms.
