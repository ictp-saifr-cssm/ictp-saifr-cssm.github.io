The population biology of ecological networks, social communication networks, brain functional networks, possibility of outbreaks, and spreading of disease through human contact networks, to name but a few examples all attest to the importance of research studies based on the dynamic interaction approach. In this talk, we will discuss the role of a new form of dynamic interaction in a network of oscillators. A time-evolving state-space dependent coupling among an ensemble of oscillators is introduced, where individual units are interacting only when the state of the system lies within certain proximity of the phase space. The proposed design of dynamic coupling facilitates the onset of a plethora of asymptotic states including synchronous states, amplitude death states, oscillation death states, a mixed state (complete synchronized cluster and small amplitude desynchronized domain), and bistable states (coexistence of two attractors). Besides the study on periodic Stuart–Landau and Van der pol oscillators, we present results for the paradigmatic chaotic models of Lorenz and Rössler along with the MacArthur ecological and FitzHugh–Nagumo neuron model systems.
