These webinars are organized by <a href="mailto:b.figueiredo@unesp.br">Benjamin Garcia De Figueiredo</a>, <a href="mailto:rparistides@gmail.com">Raul Palma</a>, <a href="mailto:danielcpjorge98@gmail.com">Daniel Cardoso Pereira Jorge</a> and <a href="mailto:joaopedrovm98@gmail.com">João Valeriano</a>, together with Professor <a href="mailto:ricardom@ictp-saifr.org">Ricardo Martinez-García</a>, and sponsored by ICTP/SAIFR. 
The ICTP South American Institute for Fundamental Research (ICTP-SAIFR) is a South American hub for theoretical physics created in 2011 as a collaboration of the <a href="http://ictp.it">International Centre for Theoretical Physics</a> (ICTP) in Italy with the <a href="http://fapesp.br">São Paulo State Research Funding Agency</a> (FAPESP) and the <a href="http://unesp.br">São Paulo State University</a> (UNESP). ICTP-SAIFR is located in the <a href="https://www.ift.unesp.br/">Instituto de Física Teorica</a> (IFT-UNESP) in downtown São Paulo. Its goals are to conduct research in theoretical physics at the highest international standards, support research in South American regions where theoretical physics is less developed, and provide an international center for schools and workshops.
